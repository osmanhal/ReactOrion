# ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript - Controllers

**No Esri Technical Support during beta.**

Package that is part of the [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript).

It is not intended to be used directly, but rather used as a dependency by other packages in the SDK.

## Introduction (for internal use only)

Controllers are a powerful code-reuse pattern for Stencil. Think
of them like React hooks or Vue Composables, but for Web Components.

They also add nice features to Stencil, like reactiveUtils integration, getters,
setters, dynamic watchers, sync methods and much more to make writing Stencil Web
Components more enjoyable.
